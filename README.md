# USB Midi HID Pedalboard

## Introduction
This project was conceived to connect controls to Virtual Pipe Organ software such as Hauptwerk, Grande Orgue, Cecilia etc running on a touch screen laptop. Flexibility is the main motivation as I have little Midi or VPO experience yet. This project may work for you too. Let me know how you get on and whether improvements should be made.

## Features
- Hosted on the STM32 Blue Pill, a $2US development board
- USB Connection to host computer, LED blink on USB send
- Multiple STM32 boards may be deployed to ease wiring or increase capacity
- Up to 156 contacts arranged as a 14 out by 12 in diode switch matrix
- Contacts may send Midi Note On/Off messages for pedalboard, stops, couplers or toe pistons
- Contacts may instead send Keyboard HID messages for turning music pages displayed on a host computer monitor
- Page turning may use a single sustain pedal type contact e.g. short press forward, long press back.
- Midi Control Change messages sent from 4 potentiometers for swell shoe and crescendo controls
- Contacts and potentiometers are individually debounced for 50ms to reduce message floods
- Midi Channel 1 is notionally assigned to foot controls, Midi Ch 2 to 24 buttons on each of up to 4 manuals.
- Midi channel numbers may be offset by adding configuration diodes or a hex switch
- Tested using Arduino V1.8.19 with STM32 extensions under Ubuntu 22.04 X86 Linux
- Active High Outputs for the best noise immunity connect to inputs via a diode and switch: 
     Output-----|>|----SW----Input
### *** RE-PROGRAMMING ***
 * If the firmware is configured to use the reserved gpio pins the Blue Pill tricky to re-program.
 * To re-program if you have problems:
 * 1. Set Boot0 Link to position 1
 * 2. Press reset
 * 3. Upon releasing reset immediately upload new code using ST-Link
 * 4. Repeat step 3 until programming success
 * 5. Move Boot0 link to position 0
 * 6. Disconnect programmer
## Enhancements
- Output drive for LEDs and displays possibly midi controlled may be needed
 ## Thanks
The code is based on the excellent examples from: https://github.com/arpruss/USBComposite_stm32f1/tree/master/examples
Also thanks to the Arduino and STM32 support teams
